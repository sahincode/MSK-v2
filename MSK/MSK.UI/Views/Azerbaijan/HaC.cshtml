A rich cultural heritage has been created on its territory over the span of many millenniums, contributing to the treasure house of World culture. The discovery of Azykh cave, the earliest habitation of man to be found in the world, and a number of habitations of the ancient Stone Age prove that Azerbaijan enters the zone of anthropoids to reveal the birthplace of mankind. The main traces of civilization are viewed in Azerbaijan. In the 3rd millennium B.C. the process of tribe formation was going on here and by the 1st millennium B.C. the first political formations had emerged. Azerbaijan State system was being formed in the 9th century B.C.: Manna state with high economic and cultural level had emerged. The pantheons of divinities were created.<br><br>Manna believed in natural phenomena; the Sun, the Moon, the first part of the 6th century B.C. Manna was conquered by Media. The official religion was Zoroastrianism, the spread of which was connected with self-kindled resources of oil and gas. <img style="margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:20px;" src="/uploads/msk_images/history2.jpg" alt="The History of Azerbaijan" width="212" height="162" align="right">A great part was played by the Atropatena and Caucasian Albania in the process of the formation of separate state structure on the territory of Azerbaijan in antiquity. The name of the country is connected with the name of the Atropatena ruler - Atropat which was later transformed into Azerbaijan. It is in Atropatena that the process of formation of Azerbaijan nationality began. In the 3rd-5th centuries the Azerbaijan state system was strengthening. Christianity was penetrating into Azerbaijan.<br><img style="margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-right:20px;" src="/uploads/msk_images/history21.jpg" alt="The History of Azerbaijan" width="212" height="162" align="left"><br>In Transcaucasus such one of the first apostolic Christian churches appeared spiritual and secular life was progressing. At the beginning of the 5th century the Albanic alphabet was introduced and promoted the development of education. The unique monuments of culture and literature, architectural traditions of that period have been preserved to the present. Azerbaijan was conquered by Arabs at the beginning of the 8th century and made part of the Arab Khalifat as the vilayet Arran.<br><br>Islam became the leading religion in Azerbaijan, creating new traditions and culture. Azerbaijanis, like all other nations that accepted Islam, were called "Moslems" and participated in the development of Moslem culture.

Azerbaijani people distinguish among other peoples with its specific image in the world culture. Cultural and literary specimen of this people created for centuries are tanned with love of life, feelings of freedom and independence.<br><img style="margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:20px;" src="/uploads/msk_images/history4.jpg" alt="The History of Azerbaijan" width="212" height="162" align="right"><br>Grand works of art of our people such as "Kitabi Dada-Gorgud", "Koroghly", coryphaeus who have left indelible traces in the history of world civilization such as Nizami Ganjavi, Afsalladdin Khagany, Khatib Tabrizy.

The names of our thinkers Nasraddin Tuisy, Aboul-hassan Bahmanyar, Mirza Fataly Akhundov, Abasgouly Aga Bakikhanov and others are well known to world science. Heroism of such popular leaders as Javanshir and Baback has been turned into a school of patriotism, embodiment of courage and unification of people.

A number of independent state formations - Khanates appeared.<br><br>The contradictions between Russia, Turkey and Iran deepened in the 18th-19th century. Wars were waged over Azerbaijan. The Turkmanchay Treaty of 1828 between Russia and Iran separated Azerbaijan and its people: the northern part of Azerbaijan was conquered by Russia, its southern part became a part of the Iranian state.<br><br>The 20th century entered the history of the Azerbaijan people as the period of radical changes in socio-economic, political and cultural life.

Various branches of science were developing, newspapers and magazines started to be published.<br><img style="margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:20px;" src="/uploads/msk_images/history8.jpg" alt="The History of Azerbaijan" width="212" height="162" align="right"><br>Formation of political societies, organizations and parties for dissemination of progressive, democratic ideas contributed to the process of becoming and developing a national identity and fueled the growth of the liberation movement of the February, 1917: The fall of the tsarist monarchy in Russia created favorable conditions for the development of national movements in its border lands. May 28, 1918: Azerbaijan rehabilitated its state struc-ture - the Independent Azerbaijan Republic was established.<br><br>Having existed for 23 months, it collapsed.

It is true that the way to independence was not easy for us and we have undergone severe tests. As a result of military aggression of Armenia against Azerbaijan, occupation of 20% of our territory by Armenian invaders more than one million of our citizens were obliged to leave their native homes and turned into refugees and displaced people.<br><br>Sabotage of internal and external forces against our statehood, disintegration of former economic relations, social and economic difficulties of the transition period and other problems have complicated our way to independence.<br><br>Nevertheless our people did not lose confidence, will and determination in our independent statehood, but on the contrary, the belief of our people became more strengthened.<br><img style="margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:20px;" src="/uploads/msk_images/history10.jpg" alt="The History of Azerbaijan" width="212" height="162" align="right"><br>As a result of purposeful policy achievements gained for recent years in the country are evident.

I can firmly say that the Republic of Azerbaijan lives in full political stability now. And this creates firm foundation to implement radical changes in different spheres of the life of our country.<br><br>The Republic of Azerbaijan as an independent country follows the way of democratic, law governed and secular state construction. Our society is being formed on the basis of democratic principles which have already been tested in the world practice and match our national peculiarities.
